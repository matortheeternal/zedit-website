<p>zEdit has a global logger which can be used to write log messages which will be appended to a log file on disk as the application is running.  The <a href="docs://Views/Edit View/Log View">Log View</a> displays the contents of the application log.</p>

<p>It's best not to pollute the log with verbose messages that are unlikely to help when debugging an issue.</p>

<span class="documentation-warning">WARNING: Several of the functions here should never be called from zEdit scripts or modules.  These functions have been marked with <span class="icon icon-warn"></span>.</span>
