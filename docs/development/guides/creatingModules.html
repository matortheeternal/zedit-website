<h2>Step 1: Prepare</h2>
<p>Before you do start designing your module, you should familiarize yourself with <a href="docs://Development/APIs">zEdit's APIs</a>.</p>

<p>Prepare a development environment for creating your zEdit module.  I highly recommend starting with the <a href="https://github.com/matortheeternal/zedit-module-boilerplate">zEdit Module Boilerplate</a>.</p>

<p>You'll want to choose a text editor or IDE as well.  Below are some options:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Webstorm</a> - A fully featured IDE from JetBrains.  It may seem a bit overkill, but some of the features are really nice to have.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> - A highly customizable, open source text editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> - Super lightweight text editor with extension support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> - Freemium text editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> - Classic text editor, limited feature-set.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Design</h2>
<p>Make a plan for what your module will do in plain English.  You can spend as much or as little time on this step as you want, but spending a more time on design can help you avoid time-consuming mistakes during the implementation step.</p>

<p>Below are some tips for designing modules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=top+down+design">top-down design</a>.  Break the task into smaller tasks until each task can be completed in a few lines of code.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">Keep it simple</a>.  If something seems too complicated, it probably is.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Implementation</h2>
<p>Write the code.  It's best to implement things iteratively, testing whenever you can.</p>

<p>Below are some tips for implementing modules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't repeat yourself</a>.  Use functions and data structures when applicable.  You will produce better, easier to debug code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/80084/is-premature-optimization-really-the-root-of-all-evil">premature optimization</a>.  Code the simplest solution, then optimize as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't be afraid to <a href="docs://Overview/Community">ask for help</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
