<p>zEdit is a Windows desktop application which provides a development environment for editing Bethesda Plugin Files.</p>

<p>zEdit is built off of <a href="https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit">xEdit's codebase</a> through <a href="https://github.com/matortheeternal/xedit-lib">XEditLib</a>.  zEdit is built with Electron, which allows it to take advantage of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript.</p>

<p>The initial development goal for zEdit is to provide equivalent functionality to the xEdit GUI, but a number of popular extensions and improvements are also being developed.  Check out <a href="docs://Overview/xEdit Comparison">xEdit Comparison</a> for a comparison of xEdit and zEdit features.</p>
