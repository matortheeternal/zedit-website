    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Theming <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit allows for custom application and syntax themes via CSS where xEdit only allowed for custom conflict colors.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Modules <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit introduces a module system, which allows developers to extend or add functionality to zEdit.  xEdit has no such system, limiting larger contributions to the main codebase or standalone applications.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Language <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            xEdit is a pure Delphi application where zEdit is an Electron application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS which taps into the xEdit codebase via a Delphi DLL file.  The developer community for JavaScript is larger and more active than the developer community for Delphi.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Performance <span class="equivalent"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit offers native Delphi performance by calling xEdit DLL functions.  Techniques such as UI virtualization and data caching are used to keep the GUI as fast and efficient as possible.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Documentation <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit ships with official documentation where xEdit has various user-created guides scattered across the internet.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Game mode support <span class="equivalent"></span></td>
        <td>
            Both xEdit and zEdit support the same games.  zEdit uses xEdit's codebase internally, so it will always be able to support the same games as xEdit.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Game mode selection <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            In xEdit game mode selection is done either via a command line parameter or renaming the executable.  zEdit allows you to select the game mode from the <a href="docs://Views/Start View">Start View</a>, and will support command line parameters in the near future.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Application modes <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit currently supports the most used "Edit" mode and a "Clean" mode for cleaning errors and dirty edits in plugin files.  LOD Generation and Translation tools may be added to zEdit in the future.  zEdit will provide dedicated zMerge and zSmash <a href="docs://Application Modes">application modes</a> in the near future.  zEdit allows you to select the application mode from the <a href="docs://Views/Start View">Start View</a>, and will support command line parameters in the near future.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Load order selection <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's <a href="docs://Modal Views/Load Order Modal">Load Order Modal</a> offers several UX improvements over xEdit's load order modal including multi-selection, extended hotkey support, disabling of unloadable plugins, what you see is what you get, and coloring combined with tooltips for disabled plugins and required masters.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Plugin loading <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit doesn't build references by default.  This results in much faster loading times compared to xEdit assuming you didn't use the hidden feature where you can hold shift to disable building references.  In addition, zEdit has a loading spinner which displays while plugins are loading instead of showing a disabled interface.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Layout <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            Unlike xEdit, zEdit offers a dynamic layout which allows you to create new views in tabs.  In the near future you will be able to split panels, move tabs between panels, save layouts, and more.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Tree view <span class="equivalent"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's <a href="docs://Views/Edit View/Tree View">Tree View</a> operates almost identically to xEdit's navigation view.  Unlike xEdit's navigation view zEdit's tree view supports custom columns, can optionally display group signatures, and can optionally hide file header nodes.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Record searching <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit offers the same record searching options as xEdit as well as the ability to search for records by FULL Name.  You can press Ctrl+F on the tree view to open the record search bar.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">User scripts <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit allows for the execution of user scripts similar to xEdit via the <a href="docs://Modal Views/Automate Modal">Automate Modal</a>.  Unlike xEdit scripts, zEdit scripts are written in ES6 JavaScript and use the <a href="docs://Development/APIs/xelib">xelib API</a>.  Script execution is often several orders of magnitude faster than it is in xEdit.  This is largely due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8">the V8 JavaScript engine</a> being vastly superior to <a href="http://jvcl.delphi-jedi.org/JvInterpreter.htm">the jvInterpreter</a>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Error checking <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's zClean application mode provides a streamlined experience for checking plugins for errors and fixing them.  It provides automatic resolution options for more error types than xEdit, and allows users to manually choose from multiple resolution options when cleaning plugins.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Record copying <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit offers the same record copying functionality as xEdit as well as additional ease of use through hotkeys and reference swapping when copying multiple records.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">File creation <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            In xEdit, the only way to create a new file is from a script or by copying a record.  zEdit offers a context menu option for creating new files as well as an option to create a new file when copying a record.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">File renaming <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit allows you to rename loaded files, which xEdit is unable to do.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Record view <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's <a href="docs://Views/Edit View/Record View">Record View</a> operates almost identically to xEdit's record tab.  Unlike xEdit's record tab, zEdit's record view allows you to collapse and expand nodes, making working with large records easier.  In addition, opening a record is done by double clicking it or dragging and dropping it in the view.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Modal value editing <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's <a href="docs://Modal Views/Edit Value Modal">Edit Value Modal</a> is similar to xEdit's edit value modal, but improves the UX for editing reference, color, enumeration, and byte array values.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Inline value editing <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit offers basic inline value editing on par with xEdit.  Reference editing is faster most of the time because zEdit requires specifying a signature and only looks for a limited number of matching references.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Drag and drop <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit supports drag and drop between master and override records on the record view the same as xEdit.  In addition, it allows drag and drop between record views and drag and drop from the tree view to set references.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Filtering <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit offers more extensive filtering functionality than xEdit through the <a href="docs://Modal Views/Advanced Search Modal">Advanced Search Modal</a>.  zEdit's filtering allows users to create a flexible set of conditional statements for filtering without resorting to writing code.  It also allows users to filter a scope of records, making filtering faster in practice the majority of the time.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Referenced by view <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's <a href="docs://Views/Edit View/Referenced By View">Referenced By View</a> operates almost identically to xEdit's referenced by tab.  Unlike xEdit's referenced by tab you can add custom columns to the zEdit's referenced by view.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Spreadsheet view <span class="planned"></span></td>
        <td>
            A view similar to xEdit's spreadsheet tab is planned but not yet included in zEdit.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="nowrap">Messages view <span class="better"></span></td>
        <td>
            zEdit's <a href="docs://Views/Edit Veiw/Log View">Log View</a> operates very similarly to xEdit's messages tab.  Unlike xEdit's messages tab, it color-codes error and warning messages.
