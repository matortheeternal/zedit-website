<h2>Installed modules tab</h2>
<p>The installed modules tab lists your currently installed modules.  Each module item lists the module's name, version, author, and description.  There's also the <b>Uninstall</b> button which uninstalls the module, deleting it from disk.</p>

<p>You can click the <b>Install Module</b> button to install a module from an archive or <code>module.json</code> file.  Note that installing or uninstalling modules does not activate them in the program immediately - a restart is usually necessary.</p>

<h2>Installed themes tab</h2>
<p>The installed themes tab lists your currently installed application themes.  Each theme item lists the theme's name, version, author, and description.  There's also the <b>Apply</b> button which applies the theme, and the <b>Uninstall</b> button which uninstalls the theme, deleting it from disk.</p>

<p>You can click the <b>Install Theme</b> button to install a theme from an archive or <code>.css</code> file.</p>
