<p>The save modal allows you to specify plugins to save, and displays the while saving plugins or closing the application.  You can open the save modal by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> on the <a href="docs://Views/Edit View">Edit View</a>.</li>
    <li>
        Attempting to close the application when there are plugins that have been modified.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Clean Mode</h2>
<p>When using the application in clean mode, the save modal will close the program even if it is opened with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.  This will be fixed at a future point in time.</p>

<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>The plugins list on the save modal responds to the same hotkeys as the <a href="docs://Modal Views/Load Order Modal">Load Order Modal</a></p>
