<p>The referenced by view allows you to view a list of records a record is referenced by.</p>

<h2>Building references</h2>
<p>The referenced by view won't display anything until you build reference information for plugins.  See the Build References action in the context menu section on the <a href="docs://Views/Edit View/Tree View">tree view</a> documentation page.</p>

<h2>Linking</h2>
<p>The referenced by view links to the first available record view it can find when it is created.  When linked to a record view it will display referenced by information for the record open in the record view.</p>

<p>You can unlink a referenced by view from the record view it is linked to by clicking the <span class="fa fa-unlink"></span> button in the record view's address bar.  When unlinked the only way to view a record on the referenced by view is through drag and drop from the tree view.</p>

<h2>Columns</h2>
<p>The referenced by displays the same columns as xEdit by default: Record, Signature, and File.  You can edit columns by clicking the <span class="fa fa-columns" title="columns"></span> icon to open the <a href="docs://Modal Views/Edit Columns Modal">edit columns modal</a>.</p>

<h3>Sorting</h3>
<p>All columns, including custom columns, support sorting on the referenced by view.  You can click on a column's header to sort by it or reverse its sort direction.</p>

<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
