<p>The progress view is displayed over the application when it is performing a large task such as executing a script.  The progress view either displays an indeterminate spinner and message or a modal with a progress bar and embedded log.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>The progress view uses transparency.  If you are running Windows 7/8/10 with Aero disabled (e.g. using a Windows Basic theme) the window will not display, making the application unusable.  You can fix this by starting the application with the <code>--disable-transparency</code> target line parameter.</p>
